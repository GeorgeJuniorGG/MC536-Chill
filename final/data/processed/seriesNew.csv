It's more than just a one night stand! When a couple gets together, it's never just the two of them - they also bring baggage - and Susan and Steve are no exception. Their baggage is a crowd of best friends and exes who talk about all aspects of sex and relationships on their never-ending quest to find true love. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps... Susan Walker is a beautiful go-getter with an uninhibited attitude who used to date Patrick Maitland, the sextet's charismatic, cocky player, London's king of conquests - a guy who's just too cool to worry about being smart. Attractive Sally Harper is a beauty therapist who is Susan's unashamedly vain best friend, who aggressively battles aging with heavy doses of moisturizer and men - including Patrick. Meanwhile, Steve Taylor, while getting together with Susan, can't seem to shake loose from his vivacious and slightly vacuous ex-girlfriend Jane Christie, a woman supremely confident in her ability to seduce anyone of either sex, and who refuses to be dumped unless she's the one doing the dumping. Jeff Murdoch is Steve's ""porn buddy"" who is, in equal parts, obsessed and bewildered by actual sex; charming in his way, but with an uncanny ability to say the wrong thing at the worst possible time. He works in the same office as Susan, with whom he had a disastrous and unsuccessful one-night fling. Coupling has been honoured with the prestigious Silver Rose of Montreux, Best TV Comedy Award, and is recent winner at the 2003 British Comedy Awards.

At the end of last season Susan and Steve discovered they were pregnant (well, mostly Susan), confirmed bachelor Patrick and Sally finally admitted their true feelings for each other, and poor Jane was left on her own, once again. But it's not all doom and gloom for Jane. As the new season opens, things are looking up. There's this guy called Oliver, who has his eye on her. Is it possible that lifetime loser in love Oliver might just get somewhere with lifetime loser in love Jane? Trouble is, his apartment is a little ""un-edited"" and his living room has lost the battle with magazine nudity... Susan and Steve are now well and truly an item. So why is he dreaming about being executed by a fetus with an axe? Meanwhile Sally and Patrick are settling into their new relationship. But since the dawn of time, men and women have been falling in love - and men have been trying to get home straight afterwards. Can fallen playboy Patrick ever find his way back from the enchanted glade of his one true love and get a decent night's sleep?"

Topics centered on nearly every inconceivable matter of concern to children, ranging from everyday fears related to going to sleep, getting immunizations, and disappointment about not getting one's way, to losing a loved one to death and physical handicaps. Rogers used simple songs and, on nearly every show, segments from the Neighborhood of Make-Believe to make his point. A scale-model trolley was often (but not always) used to segue into the Make-Believe segments, said neighborhood being inhabited by puppet characters including King Friday XIII, Lady Elaine Fairchilde and Daniel Stripèd Tiger. Frequent visitors as well as Rogers' own frequent visits to various places in the neighborhood rounded out each show. The program was taped at WQED-TV in Pittsburgh; first-run shows were produced from 1968 to 1975, at which time production was suspended until 1979. New programs were taped through 2001 for broadcast alongside the original 460 episodes, the most notable coming in 1991 with Rogers's shows focusing on calming children's fears during the Persian Gulf War."

The first time, he declined, but recommended a friend of his; Sean Connery). Unlike many other spy series at this time, Danger Man was not a comedy, nor did it go off to the outlandishness of another well-known spy series of the time (The Avengers (1961)), but was able to build a long-lasting fan base by emphasising well-written scripts, terrific guest actors as well as impeccable direction, and quality production."

Deal or No Deal,2005,120 min,5 Seasons,Outra,7+,5.0/10,47/100,"The United States' version of ""Deal or No Deal"" was based on the Netherlands game show that had premiered in 2002. The main objective of the game was identical: Select a case containing a mystery cash amount, then - after being asked to narrow the field of cases by a certain number at various intervals - decide whether to take a cash buyout offered by an unseen ""banker"" (""Deal"") or reject the offer and continue eliminating cases (""No Deal""), knowing he/she could win the grand prize of $1 million ... or far less. Each new game begins with 26 cases, each randomly distributed and held by a sexy model. The contestant chooses one case, which is placed at his/her contestant's podium. The cash amount inside could be as little as 1 cent ($.01) or as much as $1 million. The player then is asked to eliminate six of the remaining cases, calling out the corresponding numbers one at a time. After each number is called, that case is opened, revealing one of the 26 cash prizes; that prize is then eliminated from play. After the six cases are opened, host Mandell receives a call from The Banker, who makes an offer to buy back the player's case. The offer is based on the cash amounts still in play; although this initial offer is fairly small, it is usually higher if more of the small amounts - usually, those under $10,000 - were taken out of play. If the player chooses to accept the offer (""Deal""), he/she presses a button at his/her podium to confirm the decision. At that point, his/her game ends, the amount inside the case, and the cases remaining in play are revealed. However, should the contestant refuse The Banker's offer (""No Deal,"" which always happened at least on the early deals), he/she is then directed to eliminate five cases from play, after which another deal is offered, which - depending on what prizes are eliminated during this round - may be higher or lower than the previous offer. Subsequent rounds have the contestant eliminating four, three and two cases from the remaining field, with Banker deals after each elimination round; thereafter, the contestant withdraws one case each time. During these latter rounds, the contestant often received advice from a group of supporters (his/her family, friends and others) on whether to accept or decline the offer. This process continues until two cases remain - the player's and the one yet to be eliminated - and one final deal is made. Should the contestant refuse the final offer, one of two things may happen. If the game's outcome is rather anti-climatic (i.e., only very small amounts remain), the contestant's case is opened and he/she wins the cash amount inside. However, if at least one of the large amounts remains in play, he/she is offered a chance to swap cases and then given another final deal; after the player's decision, the player's case is opened and he/she wins accordingly. ""Deal or No Deal"" premiered on NBC in December 2005 with a week's worth of shows to promising ratings; a second set of five episodes in Februrary and March 2006 did just as well, earning a twice-weekly spot on the NBC prime-time schedule. During each game, home viewers are invited to play a ""Lucky Case"" game, in which they enter - via their cellular telephone keypad - which of six cases they believe contains the $10,000 grand prize. Those who select the right case are entered into a random drawing, with four winners selected (one from each time zone) to win the $10,000 prize."

Blockbusters,1980,30 min,3 Seasons,Outra,,7.3/10,39/100,"Game show which sought to resolve the question, ""Are two heads better than one?"" A single contestant competed against a team of two (related in some way but not married) to answer general knowledge questions, which allowed them to claim hexagonal boxes on a large five-by-four game board if they answered correctly. Each box had a different letter of the alphabet on it, and each question had a one-word answer beginning with whichever letter was selected by a player. The single contestant had to complete a vertical path on the board to win (a minimum of four red boxes), while the two-person team had to finish a horizontal path on the board (a minimum of five white boxes). Oftentimes, more than the minimum number of boxes were required to win a game. The first team to win a two-out-of-three-game match became the champion and played the ""Gold Rush"" for a chance to win $5,000 in cash. The same game board was used only with each box having one letter or as much as five initials to a phrase, title, name, etc. The champion, whether it be the single player or one member of the two-person team, had 60 seconds to make a horizontal connection across the board. Each clue answered correctly turned the box in question gold, while incorrect answers or passes turned a box black, making it a block that a contestant had to work around. If the champion failed to make such connection, he/she won $100 per correct answer. Teams continued until winning 10 games or being defeated. The 10-game maximum was eventually extended to 20 games, allowing previously-retired champions to be brought back to the show."

By the time word of peace finally came in early 1815, almost everyone living in the War's Western Theatre was impacted in some way by the conflict - and many had their lives forever altered."

Like the heroes of American Literature, James and his friend Todd took off cross country for the ride of their lives armed with just $250, their wits, and a healthy sense of adventure. James is an idealistic British born New Yorker who's Patriotism for America has not faltered since he first moved here 7 years ago. However, he is increasingly saddened by cynicism and the loss of hope he hears all around him. We are constantly bombarded by negative news about how bad America is, how America's future is dark and the American dream is not possible for most of it's citizens. To top it off, reality TV consistently highlights the worst of America. Combined; we are left with a self-loathing image. In this original, authentic and beautifully filmed series, we see James: an adventurous Englishman fall even deeper in love with America. And Todd, an enthusiastic American, see his own country in a whole new light. These two friends only stay with the everyday Americans they meet on the road, from the biggest city, to the smallest town, and everything in between. We hear the backgrounds and challenging stories of real Americans. We witness their views on America today and America tomorrow... what they think is right and wrong... BUT, more importantly, we learn how they are moving forward. Through the eyes of someone new to America, The American Dream Project proves that there are more good people than bad, that we have more in common than not, and that the American Spirit as well as it's Dream, is as strong as ever. To tell his story, Cole Haan partnered with Marshall's production company, Happy Marshall Productions, to bring The American Dream Project to life. James' objective was simple: reverse the negative sentiment Americans and the media are (more often than not) associating with ""America."" By using social media to connect with people, plot their course, put a roof over their heads at night and work for their keep, they were able to document and showcase that The American Dream and the optimistic spirit that built this country is very much so still alive. And now it's time to share it with the world."

Strange Curiosity,2016,,,Outra,,,10/100,"""Strange Curiosity"" is the culmination of our interest for paranormal subjects coupled with a experienced eye for production quality and cinematic storytelling. It is the canvas for us to paint the picture we see deep in our minds for not only the entertainment of the viewer, but to bring them into the story with us. Our story is a bit opposite of the norm. We started at the top--thrust right onto the worldwide scene with our show ""Ghost Lab"" on the Discovery Channel that ran for two seasons and 26-1 Hour Episodes in over 80 countries. Cancellation of the show did not cancel our desire to continue. In fact, it fueled it. Every minute of filming for a network television show taught us how to do it. We were sponges to the process. It inevitably gave us the power to create our own brand--one in which we did not have to bow to the network gods. So now we are grass roots. A band of friends taking their own time and money to film what many people call one of the best shows in its genre. But our passion to do this is not fueled by only our desire. It is perpetuated through the energy and support of our fans we made with Ghost Lab who have continued to be with us in our independent adventures with ""Strange Curiosity"". The journey from videotaping our investigations as the team Everyday Paranormal to the Discovery Channel to producing our own independent films has been a wild one, and we would like the thank our many loyal fans and supporters from around the world who have come along for the ride with us. In order to continue bringing the world new content, we are asking for small donations/subscriptions via this Patreon platform. As you know, these projects take lots of time and money, and we of all people know money is tight no matter who you are. But with a minimum two-dollar per month subscription from our fans, not only could we continue, we could become better and better. In return for our fans generosity, we will not only offer you the exclusive platform for Strange Curiosity going forward, but the longer you stay patrons, the more we will offer never-before-seen paranormal evidence, behind the scene footage, classroom experiences, virtual reality tours, discounts on merchandise AND MORE. That is why we have chosen Patreon, and we hope to see you all here very soon. This is where the party starts. Go to www.patreon.com/klingebros now and sign up for just $2 per month."

But as its ancient history attests, strife and discord are often incubators for greatness. From their beginnings as hunter-gatherers in harsh, unforgiving landscapes; to surviving the worst collapse in human history; to facing off against the greatest empire the world had ever known, the Greeks would have to overcome incredible odds to pave the way for the modern West. ¶ In National Geographic's landmark event series ""The Greek's"", historians and archaeologists, actors and athletes, scientists and artists launch a groundbreaking exploration into the ancient Greeks' journey - not just to better understand their past, but to discover how their legacy illuminates our present, and will shape our future. The story of the Greeks is the story of us."
